## Our top priorities

1. **Privacy**
  - When you sign up for a "free" website from the big web hosting platforms they are full of tracking cookies to harvest the data of your user base.
  - Your website with arts-link will only collect data you request and will never sell that data to anyone.
  - Our tracker free websites use integrations with privacy focused tools like [Plausible analytics](https://www.plausible.io) for website traffic analysis and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) for newsletters.
2. **Custom, personalized service for you**
  - We will work with you in a 1-on-1 capacity to ensure you get what you need out of your website
  - We will handle all updates for you when you need changes
3. Simple yet powerful templates to start your customization journey
  - Out of the box our templates are designed for Search Engine Optimization, Accessibility and Performance. All you need to do is provide us with images and we can get your site online very quickly.
  - If you already have a design in place we will adapt that into our optimized template
  - If you have a designer you want to work with, or want to work with one of our partner designers for a customized creation we can arrange that.
4. **Flexible payment options by the hour or by the project**
  - Using my 25+ years of building websites and web application in Silicon Valley and for Enterprise Corporations I have learned that what I enjoy is working with artists and small businesses and I am willing to set affordable rates that you can afford.
  - There will be an upfront charge to get your website built and deployed to our platform, hosting is included for most sites as well* (Very large volume projects will have some additional considerations, but I guarantee the cost will be lower than you expect.)
  - Your website can be transferred to you so you are control everything and can update it when ever you like following our easy tutorials, OR you can leave your website in our capable hands and pay a reasonable fee every time you want to make changes.
