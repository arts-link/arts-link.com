> Our mission is to empower artists and small businesses with affordable, privacy-first websites that are free from invasive tracking and tailored to your unique vision. Hereâ€™s how we deliver on that mission:

<!--more-->

1. **Privacy as a Core Value**
  - At Arts-Link, we believe in respecting the privacy of you and your audience. Your website will only collect data that you explicitly request, and we never sell or share it. Unlike major hosting platforms, our websites are free of tracking cookies and designed to respect the privacy of all users.
  - For analytics and newsletters, we partner with privacy-focused tools like [Plausible analytics](https://www.plausible.io) and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email), ensuring transparent and respectful data practices.

2. **Personalized, One-on-One Support**
  - We work closely with you to bring your vision to life and provide ongoing support for any updates or changes you need.

3. **Simple yet powerful templates built for Customization**
  - Our templates are designed for Search Engine Optimization, Accessibility and Performance. All you need to do is provide us with your Images and Content and we can get your site online quickly.
  - If you already have a design in place we will adapt that into our optimized template. Alternatively, we can collaborate with your designer if you have one -- or connect you to one of our partner designers for a customized creation.

4. **Flexible, Affordable Payment Options**
  - There will be an upfront charge to get your website built and deployed to our platform, hosting is included for most sites as well* (Very large volume projects will have some additional considerations, but I guarantee the cost will be lower than you expect.)
  - Your website can be transferred to you so you are in control everything and can update it when ever you like following our easy tutorials, OR you can leave your website in our capable hands and pay a reasonable fee every time you want to make changes.
