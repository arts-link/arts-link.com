## arts-link.com history

Formed in 1998 as a passion project to create an online gallery for some friends and family, and as a way to learn how to code websites.  You can see it's second iteration still on the [wayback machine on archive.org from 2002](https://web.archive.org/web/20020220112908/http://www.arts-link.com:80/).

It went through several design iteration, and included some efforts at e-commerce through amazon affiliate marketing, but was always just a side project.
