### WritingSos.com has lauched using the Ryder Theme from arts-link

This was a highly customized version of the Ryder Theme for Hugo websites. WritingSos.com wanted to stop paying for their hosted content management system that they never used, so they turned to arts-link.com to find out how to get set up without ongoing maintenance or service or subscription fees, with no advertising and maintaining complete control over their data.
