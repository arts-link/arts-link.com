## Draft Grant Proposal

**Project Title**  
Philadelphia Historical Marker QR Code Initiative

### 1. Executive Summary
The Philadelphia Historical Marker QR Code Initiative aims to enhance the educational and cultural experience for residents and visitors by affixing durable QR codes to approximately 300 official Philadelphia Historical Society signs. These QR codes will link to pages containing in-depth information on each historical marker’s background, significance, and related resources. By incorporating QR technology, this project will encourage digital engagement, foster deeper appreciation for Philadelphia’s heritage, and create an accessible platform for learning.

### 2. Background & Rationale
Philadelphia is rich in American history and boasts numerous official markers that commemorate pivotal events, figures, and sites. However, each sign offers only a brief paragraph, leaving visitors with limited context. By leveraging modern QR code technology, this initiative will:

- Provide direct access to carefully curated resources, such as Wikipedia entries, official city pages, or dedicated web pages.
- Offer an enhanced user experience, appealing to tech-savvy individuals and younger generations.
- Encourage both locals and tourists to explore historical narratives more comprehensively.

### 3. Project Description

#### 3.1 Goals and Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Increase public engagement with Philadelphia’s historical markers by providing easily accessible, in-depth information.  
- **Key Objectives**:
  1. Identify and catalog the approximately 300 official historical markers in Philadelphia.
  2. Research and develop or link to detailed online content for each marker (e.g., historical context, biographies, multimedia resources).
  3. Design and produce high-quality, weatherproof, vandal-resistant QR code plates for each marker.
  4. Collaborate with local institutions and potential sponsors to ensure the sustainability and accuracy of the resources.

#### 3.2 Implementation Plan
1. **Partnerships**  
   - **Philadelphia Historical Society**: To gain official permission, relevant expertise, and historical materials for each marker’s content.  
   - **Smithsonian Institution (potential)**: For support in historical research, content curation, or funding assistance if applicable.  
   - **City of Philadelphia**: Coordination for installation and any necessary permits, as well as potential city subdomain hosting.  

2. **Content Creation & Hosting**  
   - Develop a dedicated website or subdomain (potentially at a city- or society-affiliated URL) with specific pages for each marker.  
   - Where relevant, link to existing authoritative resources such as Wikipedia, local museums, or the Library of Congress archives.  

3. **QR Code Production & Placement**  
   - Collaborate with a professional printing or engraving service to create durable, weather- and vandal-resistant QR code plates.  
   - Position the plates at a height that balances ease of scanning with reduced risk of damage.  

4. **Outreach & Promotion**  
   - Work with local news outlets, tourism offices, and historical societies to publicize the new QR codes.  
   - Create a launch event or press release to raise awareness once the codes are installed.

### 4. Budget & Funding Sources
A preliminary estimate suggests funding needs for:

- **Research and Content Development**: Contract or volunteer researchers, hosting fees, and possible photography or design costs.  
- **QR Code Fabrication**: Production of ~300 durable plates and associated shipping/installation.  
- **Website Maintenance**: Hosting, domain registration (if needed), and ongoing updates.  
- **Outreach & Promotion**: Marketing materials, press releases, potential events.

Potential funding and sponsorship avenues:

- **Foundations and Grants**: Local cultural foundations, national arts/humanities grants, Smithsonian grants, etc.  
- **Corporate Sponsorships**: Technology companies or local businesses interested in boosting cultural heritage.  
- **Public-Private Partnerships**: Partnerships between the city government and private donors.  

### 5. Timeline
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Secure permissions, finalize partnerships, and begin fundraising.  
2. **Phase 2 (Months 3-5)**: Comprehensive research, content creation, and web development.  
3. **Phase 3 (Months 6-8)**: QR code design, plate production, and pilot installation on a small set of markers for testing.  
4. **Phase 4 (Months 9-12)**: Full-scale installation across all official markers, accompanied by a formal launch event and promotional campaign.  

### 6. Evaluation & Impact
- **Usage Analytics**: Track QR code scans to measure engagement and interest.  
- **Visitor Surveys**: Gather feedback from tourists and residents on the ease of use, clarity of information, and overall experience.  
- **Educational Outcomes**: Collaborate with local schools or community programs to incorporate QR code tours into class assignments.
