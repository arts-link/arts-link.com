# the benstraw theme  

v0.1 - This theme is pretty barebones, with a few additions to get things setup quickly.

## Features

- tailwindcss configured and ready to go pretty much out of the box (see below)
- fontawesome integrated and ready to go with svg icons

## Installation

- what is needed to use tailwindcss

- Check this below to see if it is correct, gotta test this on a site.
```bash
cd themes/benstraw
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
touch assets/css/style.css
npm run build-tw
# npm run watch-tw # use when working on css
```

## Configuration

- go over all the variables -- see papermod's readme

## TODO

- move fontawesome to npm package
- document alert.html partial
